AnimatedRangeBar
================

The `AnimatedRangeBar` is similar to an enhanced `SeekBar` widget, though it doesn't make use of the `SeekBar`. It provides for the selection of a range of values rather than a single value. The selectable range values are discrete values designated by tick marks; the thumb (handle) will snap to the nearest tick mark.
